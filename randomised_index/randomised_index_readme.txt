This folder contains randomised index for random selection of simulated datasets used in the paper in the form of .rds files:
1. Poisson based outbreak with Rt = 0.6 at the declining phase of the outbreak.
2. Poisson based outbreak with Rt = 0.3 at the declining phase of the outbreak.
3. Poisson based outbreak with Rt = 0.9 at the declining phase of the outbreak.
4. Negative binomial based outbreak with Rt = 0.6 at the declining phase of the outbreak (and overdispersion parameter/k = 0.52 - low overdispersion).
5. Negative binomial based outbreak with Rt = 0.6 at the declining phase of the outbreak (and overdispersion parameter/k = 0.18 - medium overdispersion).
6. Negative binomial based outbreak with Rt = 0.6 at the declining phase of the outbreak (and overdispersion parameter/k = 0.03 - high overdispersion).
